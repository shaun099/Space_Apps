            <h2>•What Does It Do?</h2>
            <div class="cont1">
              <p>
                1. Looks at the Ocean: The PACE satellite can see tiny plants
                called phytoplankton in the ocean. These little plants are super
                important because they help make oxygen, just like trees do on
                land! They are food for many sea animals too. <br />2. Watches
                the Air: The satellite can also check the air around us to see
                how clean it is. It looks for tiny bits called aerosols that can
                come from things like dust, smoke, and pollution. This helps us
                know if the air is healthy to breathe.<br />
                3. Studies the Clouds: PACE watches the clouds to learn more
                about the weather. It helps scientists understand how clouds can
                affect the Earth’s temperature and climate.
              </p>
              <h2>•What is Its Purpose?</h2>
              <p>
                The main purpose of the PACE satellite is to help scientists
                understand how our planet works. By looking at the ocean, air,
                and clouds, scientists can learn about how healthy our oceans
                are, how clean our air is and how weather and climate change
                over time
              </p>
              <h2>• Why is This Important?</h2>
              <p>
                Protecting Nature: By learning about the oceans and air, we can
                better protect them. Healthy oceans and clean air are important
                for all living things, including humans, animals, and plants.
                Fighting Climate Change: The information from PACE helps
                scientists figure out how climate change is affecting our
                planet. This way, they can help make plans to keep the Earth
                safe and healthy for the future.

              <h2>• In Summary</h2>
              <p>
                The PACE satellite is like a super spy in space, helping us
                learn about our oceans, air, and clouds so we can take better
                care of our planet!

            <h1>Introduction to Light-01</h1>
            <div class="cont1">
              <p>
                Light is what helps us see everything around us! Without light,
                our world would be completely dark. But did you know that light
                is really special: Scientists are still figuring out all the
                details, but we’ve gotten very good at describing what light
                does. For example, light travels super-fast at 671 million miles
                per hour! Or 3,00,000 kms per seconds. Nothing can go faster
                than light. We will explore these sections in this module: 1.
                Section I - What is light, and why is it important? 2. Section
                II - How does light make the colors we see? 3. Section III - How
                does light interact with things in the air like clouds and
                aerosols? 4. Section IV - How does light interact with things in
                the ocean?
              </p>

            <h2>•What is light, why is it important to us?</h2>
            <div class="cont1">
              <p>
                Light is a kind of energy that helps us see things! It travels
                in waves and can also be thought of as tiny particles called
                photons. And why is it important? Light is important because it
                helps us see the world around us, allows plants to grow by
                making food from sunlight and keeps us healthy. Excited to know
                more? We do have a quick for the video.

                That was fast!! Now do you know about transmission? It is when
                light passes through something. Imagine light as a traveler on a
                road. When it comes to something clear like glass or water, it
                can go straight through without stopping! That’s why you can see
                through windows or a glass of water—because the light travels
                through them easily and reaches your eyes. How about reflection?
                Reflection is when light bounces off something. Think of light
                as a ball you throw at a wall. When it hits the wall, it bounces
                back to you! This is what happens when light hits a mirror or a
                shiny surface. The light bounces off, and that’s how you can see
                yourself in a mirror! And refraction, Refraction is when light
                bends as it passes through something. Imagine you're pushing a
                toy car from a smooth floor onto a carpet. The car slows down
                and changes direction a bit when it hits the carpet. Light does
                the same thing when it moves from air into water or glass—it
                bends! This is why a straw in a glass of water looks like it's
                broken or bent—it’s because the light is bending as it passes
                through the water. Want to know more? Take a small detour and
                explore the world of light wonders.

                Scattering is when light spreads out in different directions.
                Imagine you throw a handful of sand into the air, and the grains
                go everywhere! Light does something similar when it hits tiny
                things like dust or water droplets in the air. Instead of going
                straight, it spreads in all directions. This is why the sky
                looks blue during the day—the sunlight gets scattered by the
                air, and the blue color spreads out across the sky! You might be
                wondering if you could actually see it, isn’t it? Take this
                quick video and enjoy yourself

                This spectrum of energy, or spectrum of light, is referred to as
                the Electromagnetic Spectrum. NASA explores the properties of
                different wavelength regions in the electromagnetic spectrum
                ranging from radio waves to gamma rays. Right around the middle
                of the spectrum we have visible light - the rainbow of colors we
                know and love. Just shorter than visible light are the
                ultraviolet wavelengths, which we wear sunscreen to protect
                ourselves from. Just longer than visible light is infrared,
                which we sense as warmth on our skin.
              </p>

            <div class="cont1">
              <p>
                Let's look closer at the visible light portion of the spectrum.
                Blue light is more energetic than red light; i.e., it has a
                shorter wavelength than red light. Specifically, we can say that
                blue light wavelengths are between 450-490 nanometers (nm) long
                whereas red light is 620-750 nm long. One nanometer is the
                equivalent of 0.000000001 meters. When discussing how light
                interacts with the ocean and atmosphere, we often refer to
                wavelengths in terms of nm.
              </p>
              <img src="asset/image/wavelength.png" alt="" />
              <h2>• How does light make the colours we see?</h2>
              <p>
                Imagine that light is like a rainbow of colors shining down on
                everything around us. When light hits an object, like a banana,
                some colors are absorbed, and some colors are bounced back.
                Think of a banana as a sponge that soaks up almost all the
                colors from the rainbow but lets the yellow color bounce back to
                our eyes. That's why when you look at a banana, it looks yellow!
                So, when you see a yellow banana, you’re seeing the color that
                it reflects while the other colors are being soaked up. It's
                like the banana is playing hide-and-seek with the colors! Colors
                come from light, and different colors are like different heights
                of waves in the ocean. When we look at something, it reflects
                some of those waves back to our eyes, which helps us see its
                color. Scientists have a special tool called a spectrometer.
                This tool helps them see which colors, or wavelengths, of light
                are bouncing off objects. For example, a green banana peel
                reflects a lot of light around the color green (about 550
                nanometers), while a ripe yellow banana reflects light in the
                red area (about 675 nanometers). Every object has a special
                pattern, like a fingerprint, called a spectral signature. This
                signature tells scientists exactly what colors the object
                reflects. So, if scientists know the fingerprints of things in
                the ocean, like tiny plants called phytoplankton or mud, they
                can tell what’s in the water by looking at the light that PACE's
                spectrometer sees. It’s like a treasure map for finding out
                what’s in the ocean!

                1. Looks at the Ocean: The PACE satellite can see tiny plants
                called phytoplankton in the ocean. These little plants are super
                important because they help make oxygen, just like trees do on
                land! They are food for many sea animals too. <br />2. Watches
                the Air: The satellite can also check the air around us to see
                how clean it is. It looks for tiny bits called aerosols that can
                come from things like dust, smoke, and pollution. This helps us
                know if the air is healthy to breathe.<br />
                3. Studies the Clouds: PACE watches the clouds to learn more
                about the weather. It helps scientists understand how clouds can
                affect the Earth’s temperature and climate.

              <p>
                The PACE satellite is like a special robot that flies high up in
                space, looking down at Earth. It helps scientists learn more
                about our oceans, the air, and the clouds!
